Teamphp
=======

Teamphp is a collaborative communication tool that allows a group of people to share a single twitter account for
broadcasting messages.

Stages
------

First stage is to get your own account up-and-running, see tweets and direct messages in your home panel. From your
account page you can send out tweets, replies or direct messages.

Second stage is to add a channel account (group account) where you can send out messages as though it's your account.

Third stage is to add members to this channel and have them also send out messages.
